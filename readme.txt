= How can I write shortcode of each widget? =

You don't need to write the shortcode or guess it at all! If you use block editor then you can use "WP Embed Widget" block and select your desired shortcode from the list. If you use classic editor then you can find WP Embed Widget button in your editor. Finally you can find the shortcode of each widget in the bottom of widget form in Appearance->Widgets menu of WordPress.

= What is WP Embed Widgets sidebar? =

It's a sidebar that do not show anywhere so if you want to configure a widget to place it in a page without showing it on a certain sidebar then you're able to put your widget in this sidebar.
